// = assignment ka work hai variable me value dalna.
 a = 5;

// Assignment means assign a value to the variable.

// == & === is comparison operator

// ==  checks value of the variable only

a = 5
b = 5


console.log(a == b)

a = 5

b = "5"

console.log(a == b)// == checks only value it does not check the type of value and it is giving the result true


a = 8 

b = "8"
 
console.log(a === b) // it is giving the result false because it checks value and type both

// TRICK FOR UNDERSTANDING

// suppose we have two containers first container have a cup and second container also have a cup, == checks the both the containers have cup or not and, === checks for the both container have cup and cup is made of same material. 

// Triple equal to is also known as strict equality
// Double equal to is known as loose equality
