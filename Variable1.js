//In any language we need variables to store values.

// To store anything we need some kind of storage.

// We can create variables by using three keywords

//let 

//const

//var   

// var is not used it is not recommanded

//The main difference between them is keywords

//  let a = 5;

// a is the name of the box and value inside the box is 5

// we need to give names to the boxes because if you want the value of the particular box how do you know if there is no name of the box


// let var and const keywords are used when you are creating the variable first time


// when you are creating the box first time and storing the value inside it is known as ASSIGNMENT.

//when you are putting the value second time is known as REASSIGNMENT.

// In starting javascript was created for very small usecase slowly it started growing the  ES6 UPDATED NEW version come in 2016.

// If we use strict mode the old javascript doesn't run

d = 45

console.log(d)

// it is not giving the error but when we use strict mode

'use strict'
 
d = 45 

console.log(d)

//  the error is d is not defined.

// Javascript was developed for very small Limited usecase.It started growing slowly.



// when you create a variable using Let keyword you can change the value of that variable.
let a = 5
a = 90
console.log(a)

// If you create a variable using const keyword you can not change the value of that variable.

/*9const t = 1
t = 2
console.log(t)*/   

// It gives error assignment to a const variable

/*let m = 4
let m = 6
console.log(m) */

// it gives syntax error  m has already been declared

// Don't use the keywords when you are reassigning the variable.

// const means constant 
 
// when you are creating a variable using const means that box is locked


// WHEN WE ARE USING STRICT MODE IT WILL TURN OFF THE OLD FEATURES OF THE JAVASCRIPT

// when we are using the var keyword for creating the variable it does two operation FIND and CREATION.it is also the old feature of javascript.It is not recommanded 

// When we use the 'USE STRICT' it will turn off the the old feature.There are many errors in old javascript.

// when we use strict mode we use only correct part of javascript.

// IMPORTANT RULES FOR VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT

/*
1- NEVER USE VAR
2- DONOT FORGET TO ATTACH LET/CONST WHILE CREATING VARIABLES
3-ALWAYS DECLARE A VARIABLE USING CONST AND CHANGE THEM TO LET ON CASE BY CASE BASIS
4-VARIABLES ARE CASE SENSTIVE IN JAVASCRIPT
